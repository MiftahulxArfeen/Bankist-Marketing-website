# 🏦 Bankist Landing Page – High-Converting Marketing Website (Frontend)

Welcome to the **Bankist Landing Page**, a sleek, responsive marketing website designed to promote the fictional digital bank "Bankist". This project is the **marketing companion** to the [Bankist Web Application](https://miftahulxarfeen.github.io/Bankist-app/), and it demonstrates how modern frontend techniques can bring a brand to life — with compelling visuals, smart interactivity, and smooth animations, all built using **HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).**
